/**
 * The MKCOL method is used to create a new collection. All DAV compliant
 * resources must support the MKCOL method.  Collections are merely
 * the HTTP name for structures like directories or folders (and, in
 * fact, often map directly to a folder or directory on the web server.
 *
 * <p>   This implementation of a MKCOL client method does not support a
 * a request body, and the newly created web collection should therefore
 * have no members.
 *
 * <p>   MKCOL creates a new collection resource at the location specified by
 * the Request-URI. If the resource identified by the Request-URI already
 * exists on the server then the MKCOL will fail.  During MKCOL processing,
 * a server will make the Request-URI a member of the URI's parent collection
 * (unless the Request-URI is "/").  If no parent collection exists, the method
 * will fail.  Thus, for example, if a request to create collection
 * <code>/a/b/c/d/</code> is made, and neither <code>/a/b/</code> nor
 * <code>/a/b/c/</code> exists, the request will fail.
 *
 * <p>   MKCOL is not idempotent (that is to say, each MKCOL request should
 * be handled by the web server, and the results of a MKCOL request should
 * not be cached).
 *
 * <h3>Example Request</h3>
 * <pre>
 * MKCOL /webdisc/xfiles/ HTTP/1.1
 * Host: www.server.org
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Example Response</h3>
 * <pre>
 * HTTP/1.1 201 Created
 * </pre>

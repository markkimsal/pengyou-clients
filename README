Resurrection
================================================================================
This project seems to have died, but I really like the GUI clients.  I am not 
saving the Java server portion of this project since I think it is a waste of 
effort to write a WebDAV server in Java.  If the GUI clients can connect to any 
WebDAV server then the project is still valuable.
